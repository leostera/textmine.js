# Textmine.js
### text mining for nodejs

Just generate a bunch of data and categorize it.

### Proposals for v0.1:

* Make it a streaming API
* Incluide ccc and pseudof error algorithms to provide dynamic numbers of clusters.
* Stop depending on textmining-js
* Build upon stem to provide more flexible and powerful natural language processing
* Use an external data storage (Redis/Memcached)

### Credits
It uses [textmining-js](https://github.com/ryouhei/textmining-js), [stem](https://github.com/cwolves/stem) and [Faker.js](https://github.com/Marak/Faker.js).
